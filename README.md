# Real-Time-Text-Detection-Using-YOLOV2
The major goal of this project is to build a Deep Learning model using YOLOV2 that can detect a Text in an Image or in a Video in Real-time.
This project is a sub part of my Major Project ”Signboard Translation from Vernacular Languages” on which I’m currently working.
